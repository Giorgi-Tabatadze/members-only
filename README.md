# members-only
Purpose of this project is to create a members only messageboard where users 
will be able to view and write different messages. 

Features of the website will be limited to different user statuses, Member and 
Admin. 

Everyone even users who have not logged in can view the messages but can not see
the authors of the message. While members can view authors as well as add their
own message and update it. 

Admins will be able to do all above plus they can delete messages and pin 
the messages to the top.
